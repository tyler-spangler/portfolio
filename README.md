### **Board Game Web Scraping and Analysis**
#### The API to gather game related data from Board Game Geek requires the use of game ids that are located within the HTML tags on the website.  To build the url for the API, I started by scraping the top 500 board games from the Board Game Geek browse board.  After getting the IDs, I can build the url for the api by adding each id to the base url separated by a comma.
